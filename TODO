Undo functionality
Julia-side macro that allows easier access to internal functions (not having to do self. etc)
Startup laggy, find cause - Kind of solved
Global vars, find a better solution
Empty files crash the editor, need handling of y-index = 0
Easier access of buffer state: maybe forwarding getindex(buffer,...) -> getindex(buffer.state,...), perhaps with symbols to access buffer.registers
Numeric states/registers/vars container to avoid parsing but maintaining narrow typing of state dict
Julia specific default functionality: Syntax highlighting, Word/Latex completion in insert/command mode
Easy to use constructors for new modes with some default functionality (escaping, insert type modes etc)
Docstrings
It's wasteful for the renderer to always render all text, it should only re-render when :top, :bottom, or the actual text changes
The method next_pos_naive calculates the word length of all following lines in the buffer. This would of course be unnecessarily slow when editing a large document. Regarding words/Words every line is at least one w/W, so the numerical argument is the upper bound for the number of lines to check.
